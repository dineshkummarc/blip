# Blip, Flat-File, Simple Blog Engine
Blip, is a really simple, no-database, flat-file blog engine<br /><br />

To Use:<br />
1.) Upload this "blog" folder to the root of your website.<br />
2.) Go into the helper.php file and update the SITEURL with your site url including the "blog" folder, so http/\/www/\/.yoursite.com/blog/ .<br />
3.) Add Blog posts to the "posts" folder as .txt files, see examples.<br />
4.) Thats it<br /><br />

Code is easily editable to create more features or change things.<br />

Potential issues: .htaccess file settings may need to be tweaked according to your Apache web server set-up, NGINX should work with some extra adjustments.<br /><br />

Tested on PHP 7.3 +, Apache Web Server, should work on shared hosting and is low resources.

> Inspiration for this project just came as a need to get a quick blog up on a website without setting up databases, and bloat. You are welcomed to contribute or fix bugs! Thanks
